# Spatial_models
This repository contains diverse scripts aimed to analyze or simulate spatio-temporal phenomena. 

The script "numerical_solutions_of_partial_differential_equations.r" contains a very simple version of a code to solve the Swift-Hohenberg equation in 1-D or 2-D space. The script is not aimed to represent a useful way to solve these system but to ilustrate the steps required to solve them. If one is interested to check other (more) efficient ways to solve spatial systems in R please check "deSolve" R package.
